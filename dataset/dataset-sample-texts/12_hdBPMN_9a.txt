To apply for the PhD program, students first fill in an online application form with their personal data. Online applications are recorded in an admission information system to which all staff members involved in the process have access. After a student has submitted the online form, a PDF document is generated and the student is requested to download it, sign it, and send it by post together with a transcript of grades and a letter of motivation. When these documents are received by the admissions office, the officer makes an initial assessment and rejects the application if the student has insufficient grades (such notifications of rejection are sent by email). In case of sufficient grades, the admissions office forwards the student documents by internal mail to the academic committee, which is responsible for deciding whether to offer admission or not. The committee meets once every month to examine all applications that are ready for academic assessment at the time of the meeting. At the end of the committee meeting, the chair of the committee notifies the admissions office of the selection outcomes. A few days later, the admissions office checks the selection outcomes and sends a rejection or admission email to each candidate.
