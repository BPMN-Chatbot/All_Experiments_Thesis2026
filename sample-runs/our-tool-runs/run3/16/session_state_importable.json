        "prompt": "The process is initiated by a switch-over request. In doing so, the customer transmits\nhis data to the customer service department of the company. Customer service is a shared service\ncenter between the departments Sales and Distribution. The customer data is received by\ncustomer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system.\n\nAfter customer data has been entered it\nshould then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and\nplausibility. In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list. The\ncomparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times. In\ncase the customer does not exist in the customer data base, a new customer object is being\ncreated which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow.\n\nThis object consists of data elements such as the customer’s name and address and the assigned\npower gauge. The generated customer object is then used, in combination with other customer\ndata to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch (including data such as\nbank connection, information on the selected rate, requested date of switch-over). In the\nfollowing an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS (customer\ninformation system) in order to confirm their successful generation. In case of a negative\nresponse, i.e. the contract documents are not (or incorrectly) generated, the causing issues are\nbeing analyzed and resolved. Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again.\nIn case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that\nthe switch-over to the new supplier can be executed. \n\n\nA request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS. It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future. \n\nThe switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for\nsupplier concurrence, and the grid operator transmits a response comment. In the case of\nsupplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the\nresolution of the conflict. The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out\nthe termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier (i.e. the\ncustomer service (of the “new” supplier) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding\ntermination).\nIf there are not any objections by the grid operator (i.e. no supplier concurrence), customer\nservice creates a CIS contract. \n\nThe customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it. Depending on the customer’s acceptance/rejection the process flow at\ncustomer service either ends (in case of withdrawal) or continues (in case of a confirmation). An\nadditional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7\ndays – after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues. The\nconfirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary (as it will count as\naccepted after 7 days in any way) but it can speed up the switch process.\n\n\n\nOn the switch-date, but no later than 10 days after power supply\nhas begun, the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old\nsupplier via messages containing a services consumption report. At the same time, the grid\noperator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier.\nLikewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer. For the customer as\nwell as the grid operator the process ends then. After receiving the meter data customer service\nimports the meter data to systems that require the information. The process of “winning” a new\ncustomer ends here.",
