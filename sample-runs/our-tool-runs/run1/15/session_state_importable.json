        "prompt": "At the beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded. A list\nwith all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO.\nAt the customer service an employee enters (based on the received data) a problem report into\nsystem T.. Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent\nand the details of the service degradation are. Based on this, the necessary counter measures are\ndetermined including their respective priorities. An electronic service then determines the\nsignificance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of\nthe contractual relationship. In case the customer is premium, the process will link to an extra\nproblem fix process (this process will not be detailed here). In case the customer is of certain\nsignificance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon, the process goes\nback to re-prioritize these measures – otherwise the process continues. Taking together the\ninformation (i.e. contract commitment data + prioritized actions) a detailed problem report is\ncreated. The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management. Service Management\ndeals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers.\n\nAfter receiving the detailed problem report, Service management investigates whether the\nproblem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at\nResource Provisioning. In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by\nthemselves, the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning. If Service\nManagement is sure they can analyze it, they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they\ncreate a trouble report that indicates the type of problem.\n\nAfter Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report, it is checked whether there are\nany possible problems. If no problems are detected, a notification about the normal service\nexecution is created. If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a\ntrouble report is created. Either trouble report or the ‘normal execution’ notification will be\nincluded in a status report and sent back to Service Management.\n\nService Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information.\nSubsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the\ninformation in the final status report. Three alternative process paths may be taken.\nFor the case that no problem was detected at all, the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service. For the case that minor corrective actions are required, Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves. Subsequently, the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service. After sending, this process path of Service Management ends. For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required, Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration. This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning. Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request – but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out, otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process. After the restoration request is received, all possible errors are tracked. Based on the tracked errors, all\nnecessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning. Then a trouble-shooting\nreport is created. This report is sent out to Service Management; then the process ends.\nThe trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then\ninto the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii). Customer Service\neither receives the actual service performance (if there was no problem) or the problem\nresolution report. Then, two concurrent activities are triggered, i.e. i) a report is created for the\ncustomer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem, and ii)\nan SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing. The report\nfor the customer is sent out to her. After all three activities are completed the process ends within\nCustomer Service. After the customer then receives the report about service performance and\nproblem resolution from Customer Service, the process flow at the customer also ends.",
