Use the provided textual description of a business process to generate or edit JSON process models.  \\nFollow these rules:\\n\\n1. Pools represent separate independent organizations. Lanes are departments or participants within a pool. \\n2. Use send and receive message events to communicate between pools only and not lanes.\\nExample Input: \\\"Customer sends a request to a company\\\".\\nExample Output: {\\\"pools\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Customer\\\",\\\"dataObjects\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Request\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"data-file\\\"}],\\\"lanes\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Customer\\\"}],\\\"startEvent\\\":{\\\"subType\\\":\\\"default\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Start Request\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0},\\\"process\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"task\\\",\\\"subType\\\":\\\"abstract\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Write Request\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0,\\\"writeDataObjectRefs\\\":[0]},{\\\"type\\\":\\\"event\\\",\\\"subType\\\":\\\"messageSend\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Send Request to Company\\\",\\\"receiveEventId\\\":1,\\\"laneIndex\\\":0,\\\"readDataObjectRefs\\\":[0]}],\\\"endEvent\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Request Sent\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0}},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Company\\\",\\\"dataObjects\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Request\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"data-file\\\"}],\\\"lanes\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Sales Department\\\"}],\\\"startEvent\\\":{\\\"subType\\\":\\\"messageReceive\\\",\\\"id\\\":1,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Receive Request from Customer\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0,\\\"writeDataObjectRefs\\\":[0]},\\\"process\\\":[],\\\"endEvent\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Request Received\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0}}]}\\n\\n3. Use send and receive message events as one-to-one. Use exclusive gateways to choose one path based on a condition. Use event-based gateways to choose a path based on incoming events.\\nExample Input:  \\\"Company prepares and sends an offer to Customer, who decides to accept or reject it. If no response is received within 10 days, the Company initiates a follow-up action\\\".\\nExample Output: {\\\"pools\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Customer\\\",\\\"dataObjects\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Response\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"data-file\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Offer\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"data-file\\\"}],\\\"lanes\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Customer\\\"}],\\\"startEvent\\\":{\\\"subType\\\":\\\"messageReceive\\\",\\\"id\\\":3,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Receive Offer from Company\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0,\\\"writeDataObjectRefs\\\":[1]},\\\"process\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"xor\\\",\\\"condition\\\":\\\"Acceptance or Rejection\\\",\\\"branches\\\":[{\\\"label\\\":\\\"Acceptance\\\",\\\"branch\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"task\\\",\\\"subType\\\":\\\"abstract\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Write Acceptance\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0,\\\"writeDataObjectRefs\\\":[0]},{\\\"type\\\":\\\"event\\\",\\\"subType\\\":\\\"messageSend\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Send Acceptance to Company\\\",\\\"receiveEventId\\\":1,\\\"laneIndex\\\":0,\\\"readDataObjectRefs\\\":[0]}]},{\\\"label\\\":\\\"Rejection\\\",\\\"branch\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"task\\\",\\\"subType\\\":\\\"abstract\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Write Rejection\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0,\\\"writeDataObjectRefs\\\":[0]},{\\\"type\\\":\\\"event\\\",\\\"subType\\\":\\\"messageSend\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Send Rejection to Company\\\",\\\"receiveEventId\\\":2,\\\"laneIndex\\\":0,\\\"readDataObjectRefs\\\":[0]}]}],\\\"laneIndex\\\":0}],\\\"endEvent\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Response Sent\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0}},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Company\\\",\\\"dataObjects\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Response\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"data-file\\\"},{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Offer\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"data-file\\\"}],\\\"lanes\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Sales Department\\\"}],\\\"startEvent\\\":{\\\"subType\\\":\\\"default\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Start Offer Process\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0},\\\"process\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"task\\\",\\\"subType\\\":\\\"abstract\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Prepare Offer\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0,\\\"writeDataObjectRefs\\\":[1]},{\\\"type\\\":\\\"event\\\",\\\"subType\\\":\\\"messageSend\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Send Offer to Customer\\\",\\\"receiveEventId\\\":3,\\\"laneIndex\\\":0,\\\"readDataObjectRefs\\\":[1]},{\\\"type\\\":\\\"events-gateway\\\",\\\"branches\\\":[{\\\"event\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"event\\\",\\\"subType\\\":\\\"messageReceive\\\",\\\"id\\\":1,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Receive Acceptance from Customer\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0,\\\"writeDataObjectRefs\\\":[0]},\\\"branch\\\":[]},{\\\"event\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"event\\\",\\\"subType\\\":\\\"messageReceive\\\",\\\"id\\\":2,\\\"name\\\":\\\"Receive Rejection from Customer\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0,\\\"writeDataObjectRefs\\\":[0]},\\\"branch\\\":[]},{\\\"event\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"event\\\",\\\"subType\\\":\\\"timer\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Wait for 10 days\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0},\\\"branch\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"task\\\",\\\"subType\\\":\\\"abstract\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"Follow-up Action\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0}]}],\\\"laneIndex\\\":0}],\\\"endEvent\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"Response Processed\\\",\\\"laneIndex\\\":0}}]}\\n\\n4.
